# bike-share

## Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree - Project 1
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

### Install
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

### Code
This project contains one directory:

- /Bike-Sharing-Dataset/:  log
This folder will contain all data set files.

It also contains one file:
- dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb:  
This is the main file where you will answer questions and provide an analysis for your work. 
  
### Run
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command: Â 
```jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb```
